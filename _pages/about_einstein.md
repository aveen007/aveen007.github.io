I am a Master's candidate in System and Applied Software Engineering at [ITMO University](https://en.itmo.ru/en/), specializing in computer vision, machine learning, and intelligent systems. My research focuses on developing automated quality control systems for industrial applications.

Currently, I work as a Research Assistant at the [Institute of Laser Technology (ILT ITMO)](https://ilt.itmo.ru/team/), where I develop real-time monitoring and control systems for laser welding quality inspection. My work involves building data augmentation frameworks using Stable Diffusion, implementing segmentation models, and creating multi-modal analysis pipelines with OpenCV and OCR technologies.

I hold a B.Eng. in Software Engineering and Intelligent Systems from the [Higher Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology (HIAST)](https://hiast.edu.sy/en/software_engineering_artificial_intelligence_program) in Damascus, Syria, where I worked on[autonomous vehicle simulations](https://github.com/aveen007/autonomous-vehicle-with-unity) using deep reinforcement learning in Unity under the supervision of Dr.Imad Issa and Dr.Omar Hamdoun.
I also contribute to urban planning simulations at the [COSM Lab](https://cosm-lab.science/ru/), where I work on my thesis supervised by Dr.[Ivan Perl](https://i-perl.ru/bc/).
